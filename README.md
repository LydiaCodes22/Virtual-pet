This is my virtual pet project, I will be creating a pet with basic properties of Name Age Hunger Fitness and Life. As age increases, fitness reduces and hunger increases. When the age is more then 30 days, or the hunger/ fitness levels drop below 0, the pet will die.It will also have feeding and walking  functions; feeding reduces unger and walkingincreases fitness.
